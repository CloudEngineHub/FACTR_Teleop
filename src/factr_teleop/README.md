## Setting up Dynamixel Servos
Before launching the FACTR teleop leader arms, the leader arms' Dynamixel servos need to be properly
configured. Please install the [Dynamixel Wizard](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_wizard2/)
software.

### Update Servo IDs
By default, all Dynamixel servos are set to ID 1. To control multiple servos with a single U2D2 controller, 
each servo must be assigned a unique ID. This assignment should be done one servo at a time, starting with 
the servo closest to the robot base and progressing up the kinematic chain. Assign IDs sequentially from 
1 up to 8, with the gripper trigger servo holding ID 8.

#### Steps to Change a Servo's ID:
1. **Connect a single servo to the U2D2 controller.**
2. **Launch the Dynamixel Wizard software.**
3. **Configure the scanning settings:**
   - In the top menu bar, go to **Tools → Options**.
   - Under **"Select port to scan"**, ensure all ports are selected.
   - Under **"Select baudrate to scan"**, choose the correct baudrate. The default is **57600 bps**. If unsure, select all available options.
   - Under **"Set ID range to scan"**, you can speed up scanning by limiting the range to **0–15**, unless the servo might already have an ID outside this range.
4. **Click the Scan icon** (magnifying glass with a gear) in the top-left corner.
   - If the servo is found, it will appear in the left panel of the window.
5. **Select the detected servo** from the panel, then click **ID** found in the middle panel of the window.
   - Select the new ID on the right panel of the window and click **Save**.
6. **Repeat** the above steps for each servo.


### Increase Servo Control Frequency
There are additional Dynamixel servo settings that must be changed in order to run the control loop at
a frequency as fast as 500Hz. The steps for each servo are as follows:

#### Steps to Increase Servo Control Frequency:
1. **Launch the Dynamixel Wizard software** and **scan for servos**.
2. **Select each detected servo** from the left-hand panel.
3. In the middle panel, click **"Baud Rate (Bus)"**:
   - On the right-hand panel, **set the value to 4 Mbps** and click **Save**.
4. In the middle panel, click **"Return Delay Time"**:
   - On the right-hand panel, **set the value to 0** and click **Save**.



In addition to the Dynamixel servo settings, it is crucial to minimize the latency of the USB port connected to the U2D2 controller
to achieve high-frequency control. The latency timer should be set to `1` for optimal performance.

#### Steps to Check and Set USB Port Latency:

1. **List connected U2D2 devices**:
   ```bash
   ls /dev/serial/by-id/
   ```
   This will show device names for each connected U2D2 controller. For example:
   ```
   usb-FTDI_USB__-__Serial_Converter_FT7WBF8S-if00-port0
   usb-FTDI_USB__-__Serial_Converter_FT951EJA-if00-port0
   ```
   Identify the one corresponding to your **leader arm**. Replace `<device-name>` with the correct name in the next steps.

2. **Resolve the full path to the USB device**:
   ```bash
   readlink -f /dev/serial/by-id/<device-name>
   ```
   This will return something like:
   ```
   /dev/ttyUSB0
   ```

3. **Check the current latency timer value**:
   ```bash
   cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/<ttyUSBx>/latency_timer
   ```
   Replace `<ttyUSBx>` with the ttyUSB device name from the previous step (e.g., `ttyUSB0`).

4. **If the value is not `1`, set it manually**:
   ```bash
   echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/{ttyUSBx}/latency_timer
   ```
   > **Note:** This command requires `sudo` permissions.


#### Automated Latency Check

Note that the provided leader arm node **automatically checks** the latency timer when initializing the `FACTRTeleopFranka` class. 
It reads the `dynamixel_port` from the YAML config file and verifies that the latency timer is set to `1`.

If the latency is not correctly set, the script will:
- Raise an exception
- Output the exact `echo` command required to fix it

Since changing the latency timer requires `sudo` permissions, **you must run the command manually** when prompted.
